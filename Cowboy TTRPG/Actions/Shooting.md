Shooting is what it says on the tin
Each bullet does 1d6 damage by default

To shoot *anything*, roll 2d6 + [[Perception skill]] + [[Agility skill]]
A roll equal to or higher than their [[Evasiveness]] hits and deals damage

A [[Critical]] miss always misses the target
A [[Critical]] hit always hits and deals double damage

Each shooting action in a row after the first has a -1 penalty for each previous shooting action 

Gain advantages and hindrances from previous actions taken this turn 
	(i.e. [[Taking aim]] or [[Movement]])

The distance to the target also affects the difficulty (*tbd*)
