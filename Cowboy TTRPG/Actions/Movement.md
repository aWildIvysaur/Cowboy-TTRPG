Movement in combat means walking or running across a flat-ish floor
Leaping over obstacles or climbing a wall cannot be done mid movement
Small movements such as adjusting behind [[Cover]] or moving within touch range does not require a move action

Taking a move action allows the character to move 5+[[Agility skill]] meters   

Taking multiple move actions without any other action between is more efficient for your character than stopping or starting. 
Each move action after the first adds an extra 2 meters beyond the normal distance
However characters also get -1 to each roll to hit with any ranged attack for the rest of the round for each move action taken beyond the first
