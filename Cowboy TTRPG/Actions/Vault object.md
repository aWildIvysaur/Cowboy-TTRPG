Vaulting an object is an action you can take when near (within 1 meter) of the object
If there is a empty space within  [[Agility skill]] meters from you, opposite the vaulted object, you may land there. You may also stay on top of the vaulted object if there is a space available.

When vaulting, you may pass over characters taking cover behind the vaulted object as long as there is a valid place to land within range behind them

If there is a valid space adjacent to the vaulted object, on the side that your character will land, you may take cover behind the vaulted object without taking the [[Taking cover]] action
