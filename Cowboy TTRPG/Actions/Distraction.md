The distraction action may be taken by anyone wanting to divert attention towards them. This is often done by shooting and/ or shouting

A distraction may be made in or out of combat

When a distraction is made, choose a point that you have shot (i.e. a bottle, or a point on the floor) or the point where you are standing and shouting. 
Every character within [[Aggressive speaking skill]] meters makes rolls 2d6 + [[Perception skill]] + [[Aggressive speaking skill]].  Any roll under 10 + your [[Aggressive speaking skill]] + your [[Perception skill]] is distracted and immediately turns to look at that location.

If multiple distraction actions are made consecutively by the same character in the same round, distracted characters look towards the closest to them
If another distraction is made after any other action, any already distracted creatures will be distracted by the newer distraction point
