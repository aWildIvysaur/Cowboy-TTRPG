Instead of conversations and combat being two separate systems, tension is a way of talking before a fight, that affects the fight
Have a [[Tension Meter]] that gets higher and lower depending on actions and reactions taken by players and NPCs
Have an initiative in conversation so NPCs and [[Characters]] can have a back and forth
Tension can either start a fight on the spot, end in a dual being issues, participants walking away with a grudge, or agreements being made
