In combat [[Characters]] have 6 actions to make, representing the 6 bullets in their gun.
These actions could be moving, shooting, casting spells, distracting, threatening, etc
In an unformal combat setting (i.e. bar fight), enough non-violent moves (threatening, talking...) could push combat back into [[Tension]] with the tension point being close to the unruly-violent quadrant

Examples of actions are:
* [[Movement]]
* [[Vault object]]
* [[Taking cover]]
* Causing a [[Distraction]]
* [[Shooting]] someone or something
* Swinging with a [[Melee]] weapon
* Using [[Magic]]
