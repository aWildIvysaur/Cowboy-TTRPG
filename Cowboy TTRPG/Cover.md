Cover is an important way of not getting shot in a fight
A character is considered "behind cover" if they are mostly hidden from the shooter
This could be round a street corner, or hiding behind a bar
This would not include standing up behind a turned over table, where the character is mostly visible from the hips up

Characters can take cover behind something that would not normally completely cover them from attackers by taking the [[Taking cover]], i.e. ducking behind a saloon bar

Characters in cover cannot be targeted by anything unless the targeting character  can move around the cover or move close enough to look over/round the cover

Shooting or Melee attacking a creature behind cover while you are next to the same cover has {insert disadvantage here}
